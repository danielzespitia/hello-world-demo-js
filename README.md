# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of your software}

### Description

This small repository contains a minimal Node.js program that prints "Hello, world!" and a couple of environment details. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a basic Node.js program structure and provide clear instructions to run it locally. It is intended as a learning exercise for practicing Node.js and basic project setup.

{Describe your purpose for creating this software.}

### Purpose

- Show a minimal runnable example in Node.js.
- Demonstrate how to provide simple project metadata (`package.json`) and a README with run instructions.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
